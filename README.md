# Pothole-Segmentation-using-YOLOv8
A computer vision project for detecting and segmenting road potholes in images and videos using YOLOv8 segmentation. Trained on a custom pothole dataset and supports video-based inference.

# Pothole Segmentation using YOLOv8

This project implements **pothole detection and segmentation** using the **YOLOv8 segmentation model**.
The model is trained on a pothole image segmentation dataset and can perform **frame-by-frame segmentation on videos**, highlighting pothole regions on roads.

The project is suitable for academic demonstrations, computer vision learning, and smart transportation applications.

## Model Used

* **YOLOv8 Segmentation (`yolov8n-seg`)**
* Trained on a custom pothole segmentation dataset
* Output includes segmentation masks over detected potholes

---

## Setup Instructions

### Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate:

* **Windows**

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

* **Linux / macOS**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Training the Model

```bash
python scripts/train.py
```

> Training on CPU can be slow. GPU-based training (e.g., Google Colab) is recommended.

The trained model will be saved at:

```
runs/segment/train/weights/best.pt
```

---

## Video Inference

1. Place your input video in:

```
inputs/input_video.mp4
```

2. Run segmentation:

```bash
python scripts/infer_video.py
```

3. Output video will be saved to:

```
outputs/segmented_output.mp4
```

---

## Notes

* VS Code may not preview `.mp4` files correctly.
  Use **VLC Media Player** or **Windows Media Player** to view results.
* Short videos are recommended for CPU inference.

---

## Dataset

The dataset used for training contains annotated pothole images with segmentation labels in YOLOv8 format.

---

## Future Enhancements

* Real-time webcam pothole detection
* Web-based UI using Streamlit or Flask
* Mask-only output for damage analysis
* Performance optimization for edge devices
